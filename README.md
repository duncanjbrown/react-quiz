A toy app I built to learn React and Redux. 

Build with `npm install` and run with `webpack-dev-server`.

It is a functional copy of the FT's firstFT quiz https://ig.ft.com/sites/quiz/firstft-2016-06-10/

### Features

- Show an exciting popover when a question is answered :)
- Add questions dynamically with animations
- When a question is answered, indicate which answer was correct and show an
	explanation of the correct answer.
- Show the final score
- Built with 100% stateless components
